# Pokemon Battle
This project simulates a Pokémon battle, integrating strategic artificial intelligence mechanics to choose moves, switch Pokémon, or use items optimally. Users can directly participate in battles against an AI. The system includes features such as Pokémon healing, move effectiveness calculation based on types and dynamic Pokémon selection, offering an interactive experience that is as faithful as possible to the dynamics of Pokémon games.
